* Activity_Label : activities performed by the subjects
	* WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING 
* Subject : id of the volunteers who performed the tests. Coded from 1 to 30
* A vector  containing the average for each activity and subject of 66 measures extracted from the original study.
The original study covered 561 measures, the 66 of this study are those related to  average and standard deviation.
